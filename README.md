This is a project to learn advanced data pre-processing with images and to get strong with deep learning algorithms and its fundamentals.

This project uses the dataset from 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dmitrygaus/gigaflexhicle

This dataset is of size 100GB and contains around 406k images of trucks/cars/busses of 865 brands and around 9000 unique vehicles.
The goal of the project is to develop a Deep Learning algorithm advanced enough to train on these data and be able to predict all the vehicles it has been trained upon.
